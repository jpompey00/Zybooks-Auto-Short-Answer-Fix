# ZyBooks Automator
## Extension by Prath: https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/zybooks-auto/bjkbhcempihbcacfghfmcmabfhehoiao
## Original Description:
Simple Chrome Extension to complete ZyBooks participation assignments.

Working Modules:
* Animations
* Multiple choice
* Short answer **NEW!**

Not Working:
* Drag and drop modules


## Fix by Me:
Short Answers would break when it came to characters that HTML writes out weirdly.
This has been fixed AFAIK. Any issues I may or may not fix, who knows :D

## Installation:
Set Chrome to Developer Mode then Select "Load Unpacked"
Select the folder and it gets loaded in! :O
